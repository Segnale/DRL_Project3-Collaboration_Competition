# Deep Reinforcement Learning Project #3 - Report
Here below are reported the main characteristics of the Reinforcement Learning algprithm.

## Learning algorithm
Considering the nature of the action/state space the selected RL Algorithm was a Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient.

## Results

The trend below shows the score avarege on 100 episode achieved by the agent across the learning process.
![Results](results/Training_201904091107.png)
The 0.5 score is reached around episode 600 with a stable improvement of the agent. After the 600 episodes the results are not so stable but the score achieves peaks of 1.

Running the trained model, the two agent easly keep the ball in game for the entire duracion of the episode marking scores of 2.6.
